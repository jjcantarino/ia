  Search the deepest nodes in the search tree first
  [2nd Edition: p 75, 3rd Edition: p 87]

  Depth-First Search (instance of Graph-Search Algorithm)
  - DFS uses LIFO queue (where most recently generated node is chosen to be expansion),
  which must be deepest unexpanded node (one deeper than its parent)
  - Proceeds to deepest levels nodes in current frontier first
  (where nodes have no successors)
  - Expand deepest level nodes, then remove them from frontier, then
  "back up" the search in reverse to the next deepest node (that still
  has unexplored successors)
  - Graph-Search version avoids repeated states and redundant paths, and is
  complete (since all nodes eventually expanded)
  
  Your search algorithm needs to return a list of actions that reaches
  the goal.  Make sure to implement a graph search algorithm 
  [2nd Edition: Fig. 3.18, 3rd Edition: Fig 3.7].

  function GRAPH-SEARCH(problem) returns a solution, or failure
    initialize the frontier using the initial state of problem
    initialize the explored set to be empty
    loop do
      if the frontier is empty then return failure
      choose a leaf node and remove it from the frontier
      if the node contains a goal state then return corresponding solution
      add the node to explored set
      expand chosen node, adding resulting nodes to frontier
        only if not in frontier or explored set
  
  To get started, you might want to try some of these simple commands to
  understand the search problem that is being passed in:
  
  print "Start:", problem.getStartState()
  print "Is the start a goal?", problem.isGoalState(problem.getStartState())
  print "Start's successors:", problem.getSuccessors(problem.getStartState())
